# Professional README Generator
## Description
For this project, I created a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). Each README includes what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions.

## Table of Contents
- [Usage](#usage)
- [User Story](#userstory)
- [Acceptance Criteria](#acceptancecriteria)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Usage

## User Story

```md

```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
